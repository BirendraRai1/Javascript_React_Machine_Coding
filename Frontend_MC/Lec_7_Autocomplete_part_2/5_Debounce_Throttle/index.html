<!-- Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, 
    without blocking other elements on the page. 
    Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading. 
    In most cases, async is the better option â€” but there are exceptions. -->

<!-- when we want to send request like matrix to search in google in normal
        case it sends six request m,ma,mat,matr,matri,matrix which causes a heavy request which
        we don't want this can be controlled using debouncing -->

<!-- In similar case throttling is used when we want to scroll on mouse or resizing a window or mouse move -->
