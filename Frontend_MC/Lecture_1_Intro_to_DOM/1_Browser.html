       * Q what do you understand by browser?
       *
       *  Browser : software application that helps us to access information on the internet and
       *  present it into a human understandable  format
       *
       * Q What are the different components/ features that makes up a browser
       * 1. cookies , local storage, session storage .These are the storages we have
       * addressbar,button , tabs are part of User Interface
       * JS engine,
       * Rendering Engine:- that converts the code into UI
       * Networking:-capability to connect with third party server and get data from there or send data to that
       * history
       * Browser security model
       * Dev Tools
       * when you have a browser you can download an application but you cannot automatically install an application
       *
       *
       * Q How does browser allows to access the above features for developer for developing a UI app ??
       *   * WEB APIs : is the interface to access all the components or the features
       *   *  API (Application Programming Interface) : API is an object  that represents a feature
       *      . Developer can interact with API using it's exposed property and methods
       *   * You can use JS to interact with all these API
       *    APIs are object.
       *   * Web APIS : console, DOM API(use case of DOM api is to talk with DOM), Web storage API (local storage, cookies, session storage).
       *   Fetch API(for networking),
       * Note :  These all web API and JS forms your browser env
       *
       *
       *
       * * So the First Principle is :- To implement any feature .You have to use an API given by Browser
       * and that API is always an object .That object use method and properties and we will use JS to do it
       *
       * What do you think document is??
       * Document is an object
       *
       * In a browser world we have certain set of features.Those set of features are exposed by their web api.
