## Problem statement 
 We have to create Autocomplete/ Typeahead

## Must Haves 

* On typing inside the search box , 
it should suggest related terms

* use this api point to fetch the data : 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}

* user should be able to select one of the options

## Good to Have 

* search should be performant enough 
* it should avoid unnecessary network call that means time
* after last keystroke before making API call.You should 
* not change for every keystroke
* it should persist previously fetched data
* error scenario ? if api returns error


## Scoping 
* is there any design   
* Data source
    Interviewer will give you an api .You have to get data from there
    or 
    use some local data in the form of promise with certain delay
* minimum number character after which the first search
 should happen
* should there be any defaults

<!-- 
JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. 
This makes it easier to maintain a code-base. 
Modules are imported from external files with the import statement. 
Modules also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag. -->
