Q>Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces

Ans>var reverseWords = function(s) {
   s = s.split("")
   let n = s.length
   for(let i=0,j=n-1;i<j;i++,j--)//swap the entire string letter by letter
    swap(s,i,j) 

   for(let l=0,r=0;r<n;){
       while(r<n && s[r]!=" ")
        r++
        for(let k=l,m=r-1;k<m;k++,m--) //swap the reversed string word by word
          swap(s,k,m)
        l = r+1
        r++
   }
    return s.join("").trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ')//trim Remove leading and trailing spaces
    // replace replaces multiple spaces with a single space
};


function swap(s,i,j){
    let temp = s[i]
    s[i] = s[j]
    s[j] = temp
}
