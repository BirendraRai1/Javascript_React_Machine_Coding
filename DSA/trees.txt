Q>Given a binary tree, where every node value is a number. Find the sum of all the numbers that are formed from root to leaf paths. The formation of the numbers would be like 10*parent + current (see the examples for more clarification).
solution>class Solution {
    treePathsSum(node,currentSum =0) {
        // code here
        if(node ==null)
            return 0
        currentSum = currentSum*10+node.key
        if(node.left==null && node.right==null)
            return currentSum
        return this.treePathsSum(node.left,currentSum)+this.treePathsSum(node.right,currentSum)
    }
}
